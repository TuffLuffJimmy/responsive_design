My name is Jimmy Echternach. I was born in Washington state and grew up in Oregon. When I was young I had a passion for animals - especially snakes and other reptiles. I was not athletic but with hard work I was able to earn a blackbelt in Taekwondo. In college I studied computer science for one year at Oregon State University before entering the workforce. I managed a UPS store for the lst several years. Now I am ready to restart my education and learn all there is to know about web coding.







My hobbies include:
Learning Russian
Walking with my dog
Studying philosophy
